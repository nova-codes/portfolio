# OO2: Responsive Portfolio

The basis of this assignment was to utilize Bootstrap to create a portfolio with a responsive layout. A responsive layout means it maintains its styling but adjusts automatically based on the screen size of the device used to view it.

Bootstrap is a CSS - and Javascript - framework, easily installed to create a responsive layout without too much effort from the developer. It provides a good starting point to making a professional website for users of any skill-set.
